Analysing the performance of Electric Vehicles under different weather conditions using Python

# EV Range Analysis

This project analyzes how Electric Vehicles (EVs) perform under different temperature conditions using Python. The goal is to assess which EV models maintain the best range under extreme temperatures.

## Project Structure:
- **src/**: Python scripts for calculating and visualizing EV ranges.
- **data/**: Datasets containing information about EV models and their ranges.
- **images/**: Plots and visualizations generated from the analysis.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/sevo7/EV-Range-Analysis.git
2. Navigate to the `src` folder and run the analysis script: python src/Real range of EV's at various weather temperatures.py


## Dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
